# Something about me maybe

Hi, I'm a Batman, but for the web. Hoodie up, fingers tap-dancing on the keyboard, I'm not just breaking codes; I'm breaking stereotypes, one firewall at a time.

While my classmates are counting sheep, I'm counting vulnerabilities. But hey, don't sweat it, I'm mostly on the side of the good guys. Wink wink.

In a world where your data is more valuable than gold, I'm the one standing guard against the digital baddies. So, if you ever need someone to outsmart the online villains or just chat about the latest security tech, you know who to hit up. Here's to being a nerd by day and a hacker by night!
